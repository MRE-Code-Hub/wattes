COMPILING AND INSTALLING
========================

1. INTRODUCTION

This should tell you everything you need to know to compile and install the 
WATTES library.

2. REQUIREMENTS

Before we begin, the software requirements for WATTES are:

- GCC v4.8 onwards with GFortran, or Intel compilers v15.x onwards
- An MPI distribution (OpenMPI or MPICH) for your chosen Fortran compiler
- A CFD package with source, to link the WATTES library to.

That's it. There may be additional dependencies for your CFD package; please 
refer to its documentation.

3. COMPILING

First inspect the Makefile. Of particular note are the following variables:
- prefix . (WATTES will be installed in prefix/lib)
- FC (Fortran compiler, should be 'mpif90' or 'ftn' on Cray systems)
- FFLAGS (default are for GCC/GFortran, although examples also shown for Intel)

Once these are correct for your system, type 'make'. If all goes well, the 
library file(s) should appear in lib/ .
